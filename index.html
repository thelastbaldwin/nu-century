			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<a href="#" class="faq-question">How do I obtain a bid? How quickly do you respond?</a>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>We obtain bids through referrals, telephone, fax or email. We respond with a walk through of your facility within 24 hours of receiving the information of interest and pride ourselves in delivering a bid by fax or in person within 24 hours of the walk through on "normal" bids. We will sit down with you and discuss your specific needs and then translate those into the work specifications document.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#"" class="faq-question">What if I am dissatisfied with the service? What steps do you take to correct any problems?</a>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>We have several guidelines in place to ensure customer satisfaction:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We obtain as much information up front from the customer to make sure your needs are clearly spelled out.</li>
							<li>We have a customer log book in each facility to correct any problems that might arise quickly, by helping communication between the janitor and the account.</li>
							<li>We keep track of all customer complaints and how the janitor has responded.</li>
							<li>We do walk-throughs to determine whether specifications are met.</li>
							<li>We monitor all chemical usage and review cleaning techniques to enhance the janitors cleaning of your facility.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#" class="faq-question">What are your terms?</a>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Currently, net 25 days from receipt of invoice. We bill at the beginning of each month or pro-rate any service which does not start at the beginning of the month.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#" class="faq-question">How do I determine what frequency of service I need?</a>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Three main factors determine a cleaning schedule.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Level of cleanliness desired</li>
							<li>Density of the facility (i.e., how many people are in the building per square foot)</li>
							<li>Whether or not a routine general maintenance of the facility is requested.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If these questions are answered upfront in the initial walk through, then the suggested level of service will be determined and quoted.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#" class="faq-question"> Do you specialize in other areas of cleaning?</a>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>
							We have special ongoing programs with many customers for doing floor maintenance, including stripping/scrubbing vinyl floors and cleaning carpets. We also wash windows and are involved in construction cleanup.
